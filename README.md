# monocentric_city
Model of commuting/location behavior of a monocentric city model

Based off of the  William Alonso model that determines based of a utility function between people's rent and time commute preference will determine the shape of a city. Added a simulated "train" that distorts the radial aspect of commutes to change the shape of perfered location.
